    <p>This is Divya Shree Moka. I would like to spend more time with myself. I read novels, sing songs and make reels when I get free time. I read more self-help books. "Atomic Habits" by James Clear is my favourite book. The last book I've read while I'm in India is "It ends with us" by Colleen Hoover.</p>
    
    <h3>MOANA</h3>
    <p>An adventurous teenager girl sails out on a daring mission to save her people in their Island. During her journey, Moana meets Maui, who guides her in her quest to become a master way-finder. Together they will sail across the open ocean on an action-packed voyage, encountering enormous monsters and impossible odds. Along the way, Moana fulfills the ancient quest of her ancestors and discovers the one thing she always sought: her own identity.</p>
